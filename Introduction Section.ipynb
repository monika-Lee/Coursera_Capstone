New appartments, new restaurants can be found anywhere in Texas. As an individual who have lived in Texas for amost five years, I really feel the development of the State. As a third-populated state in the US, living in Texas is very comfortable and relaxed. The traffic is good here as well as the public transporation system.\nAs the expanding econemy and population of Texas, the demand of new appartment is increasing dramatically. Therefore, we believe that a new appartment business in Texas will be profitable and worth investing."
